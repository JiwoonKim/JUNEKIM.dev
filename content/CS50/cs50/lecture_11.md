### CS50 Wrap Up
- CS50 = essentially about __problem solving__
- goal has been to __teach you to teach yourself__ (as how Google and stack overflow became your support structure)

#### Problem Solving
- input -> algorithms (well-designed) -> output
- not one right answer (think about __trade-offs__)
- __abstraction__ = problem-solving tool
    - the idea of taking something complicated but not worrying about the underlays; bootstrapping
