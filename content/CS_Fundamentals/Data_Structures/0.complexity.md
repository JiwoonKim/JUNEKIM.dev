### Complexity
approximate measure of the efficiency of an algorithm
- time complexity: how much time takes in respect to input size
- space complexity: how much space takes in respect to input size

#### Asymptotic Notation
- __O(n)__: performance <= n
- __Θ(n)__: performance = n
- __Ω(n)__: performance >= n
