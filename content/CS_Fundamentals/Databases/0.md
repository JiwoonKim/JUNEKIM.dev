### Database
= __model of reality__

#### Model
represent a certain structure of reality using general rules and concepts
- model is a __means of communication__
    - ex. map: up = north, bottom = south, blue = water, contour lines on a mountain
- __Data Model__: a model to represent a certain __structure of reality__
    - data structures + integrity constraints + operations
- architecture
- metadata

#### DBMS (Database Management System)

- used to help effectively control and maintain the database
- considerations: overhead of security, concurrency control, recovery costs, 

### Data Modeling
process of creating 
process of fixing a perception of structures of reality and represent this perception
1. create model: extended entity relationship model
2. represent model inside database: relational model
in the data modeling process we select aspects and abstract them

### Process Modeling
process of fixing a perception of processes of reality and represent this perception
- processes are not represented in the database
- rather, reflected in the way we use the database via the dbms
    - embed in data manipulation code inside a program
    - or data manipulation code directly on the database

### Database Efficiency

### Database Application Development Methodology
analysis, specification, design, implementation
