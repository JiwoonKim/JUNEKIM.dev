### 리액트의 배경
react = ui library

### 리액트 주요 개념들
declarative, component-based, learn-once-run-everywhere, data

#### Declarative Programming
DOM을 직접적으로 

Dom manipulation is one of the biggest performance bottlenecks. It takes a long time for Dom changes to happen.
The browser has to do two really intensive operations.
- One is to repaint. That is change an element and added onto a page
- then refloat which is to recalculate the layout of the page and move things around if need be.

So changing the Dom was a really expensive operation.

직접적으로 일일이 getElementById()해서 addChild() 등을 하는 것보다는
일단 어떻게 생겼는지 알려주면 리액트가 알아서 그걸 효율적으로 만들어주는 것
이렇게 하면 STATE를 한데 모아서 관리할 수 있다

is where the name React came from. The name React is simply saying hey based on whatever the state or

data of the app is that describes our app, I'm just going to React to it and change everything for you

so that you get the display that you want.

virtual dom

#### 컴포넌트
lego block처럼 애플리케이션 만들기
reusable components

#### unidirectional data flow

#### Just UI, the rest is up to you
react는 ui만 만들 수 있게 하고 추가적으로 필요한 건 알아서 각자 할 것
write once use everywhere

### how to be a great react developer
- decide on components
- decide the state and where it lives
- what changes when states change
