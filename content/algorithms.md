### Random Access Memory (RAM)
__where variables are stored__ (a.k.a memory)
- 그림
- computers keep track of variables (numbers, strings, arrays, etc.) to run code
- structured like __tall bookcase w/ billions of shelves__
    - each shelf holds 1 byte (8 bits)
    - shelf number = address
- processors access variables via the __memory controller which has direct access to each shelf (by indexing the address)__
- processors also __use cache to speed the access time__
    - cache = storing nearby content of recently accessed addresses
    - this makes reading sequential memory faster than jumping around addresses

#### RAM (memory) <-> Disc (storage)
- memory: faster but less space, direct access (by indexing address)
- storage: slower but more space, no direct access (have to use head on disc)

### Binary Numbers
the number system computers use

### Fixed-width Integers

### Arrays

### Strings

### Pointers

### Dynamic Arrays

### Linked Lists

### Hash Tables
