- __where variables are stored__
    - (so that computers can keep track of variables (numbers, strings, arrays, etc.) to run code)
- think of really __tall bookcase w/ billions of shelves__
    - each shelf holds 1 byte (8 bits)
    - shelf number = address
- cf) RAM (memory) <-> Disc (storage)
    - memory: faster but less space
    - storage: slower but more space
