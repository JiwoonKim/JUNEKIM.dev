### DNS (Domain Name System)
- a hierarchical distributed naming system for computers, services, or any resource connected to the Internet or a private network
- it associates various information with domain names assigned to each of the participating entities.
- mostly, it translates domain names, which can be easily memorized by humans, to numerical IP addresses
