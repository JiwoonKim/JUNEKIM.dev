### the Languages that run the Web
- __HTML__: adding __meaning__ to raw content by marking it up
- __CSS__: __formatting__ that marked up content
- __JavaScript__: making that content and formatting __interactive__

#### Web Development
- mastering HTML, CSS, and JavaScript is only a __prerequisite__ for becoming a professional web developer
- there are a bunch of other practical skills that you need to run a website (__setting up environments to build and deploy a website__):
    - organizing HTML into reusable templates, standing up a web server, moving files from your local computer to your web server, version control, setting a domain name to point to your server

### HTML
- HTML markup should provide __semantic__ information about your content (not presentational information)
- it should define the __structure__ of your document, leaving its appearance to CSS
    - `<em>` > < i > & `<strong>` > < b >: bcuz emphasized text can be displayed in all sorts of ways (not just italicized but maybe in different font, color, size, etc.)
    - < br/> should not be abused; each one should convey __meaning__; not to add a bunch of space (CSS should do this)
- HTML5 attempted to create a __clear separation between a document's structure and appearance__

### CSS
- provides __presentational information__ of how the content is presented to the user
- it defines the __design__ of your page, determining things like font size, margins, colors, etc.
