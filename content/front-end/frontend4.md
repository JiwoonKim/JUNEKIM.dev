> what HTTP, CORS, and Web Sockets are

### HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol)
- an application protocol for distributed, collaborative, hypermedia information systems.
- it is the foundation of data communication for the World Wide Web

### CORS (Cross-origin resource sharing)
- a mechanism that allows restricted resources (ex. fonts) on a web page to be requested from another domain outside the domain from which resource originated

### Web Sockets
- a protocol providing full-duplex communication channels over a single TCP connection.
