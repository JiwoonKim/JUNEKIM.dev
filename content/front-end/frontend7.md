### Design (for developers)
- making an interface that works well
- you don't need to know @ golden rule, typography and so...

### how can we create effective & basic designs?
- __reduce visual clutter__, by
    - keeping the number of fonts and colors low,
    - add white space,
    - and line things up
- aim for __clean__ design

#### basic design principles to reduce clutter
1. __grid__: line things up since pixel differences add to clutter are definitely unconsciously noticed
2. __color__: keep your color complimentary
    - use mostly neutrals + one brighter color for important bits

3. __fonts__: keep it simple
    - _keep the number of fonts low_: 2 different fonts is usually a good rule of thumb
    - _use fancy/display fonts sparingly_ since it is very cluttery; generally avoid them
    - instead, vary weights (bold), style (italics), and transforms (uppercase, etc.) to _differentiate bits_

4. __white space__: the ultimate clutter reducer!

#### User experience principles
- make the most important action on your design __easy to find and use__
    - ex. make the important button stand out and clickable (with color)
- pay attention to your goals on what you're designing and how it's designed and used

#### Content principles
- content is also a big sign of clutter
1. __less is more__: make it shorter, simplier, easy to read (well, actually skim)
    - parse big paragraphs into bullets
    - add boldings
    - add white space between bullets
2. __headlines__: _short, sweet, and simple_
    - talk benefits, not details
        - ex. introduction to building web apps using python and django보다는 learn how to build a web app
        - ex. download 보다는 send me free info
    - keep it short
    - use natural, friendly language; sound human, not a robot
        - ex. email 보다는 add your email here

#### Images and Imagery
- stock photos usually look like stock photos
- you can still accomplish a lot with __just type and screenshots__
- remember to pay attention to file size
- don't forget retina-quality images
