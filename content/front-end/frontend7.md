### Design (for developers)
- making an `interface that works well`
- you don't need to know @ golden rule, typography, etc.

#### how can we create effective & basic designs?
- `reduce visual clutter`, by
    - keeping the number of fonts and colors low,
    - add white space,
    - and line things up
- aim for `clean design`

### Basic design principles (reduce clutter)
1. `grid`: __line things up__ since pixel differences add to clutter are definitely unconsciously noticed
2. `color`: keep your color complimentary
    - use __mostly neutrals + one brighter color__ for important bits
    - [shortcut templates](https://www.colourlovers.com/palettes/most-loved/all-time/meta)
    - [a simple guide for colors](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2016/04/web-developer-guide-color/)
3. `fonts`: keep it simple
    - __keep the number of fonts low__: 2 different fonts is usually a good rule of thumb
    - __use fancy/display fonts sparingly__ since it is very cluttery; generally avoid them
    - __instead, vary weights (bold), style (italics), and transforms (uppercase, etc.)__ to differentiate bit

4. `white space`: the ultimate clutter reducer!

### User experience principles
- make the most important action on your design __easy to find and use__
    - ex. make the important button stand out and clickable (with color)
- __pay attention to__ your goals on __what you're designing__ and __how it's designed and used__

### Content principles
content is also a big sign of clutter
1. `less is more`: make it __shorter__, __simplier__, __easy to read__ (well, actually skim)
    - parse big paragraphs into __bullets__
    - add __boldings__
    - add __white space__ between bullets
2. `headlines`: __short__, __sweet__, and __simple__
    - __talk benefits__, not details
        - ex. introduction to building web apps using python and django < _learn how to build a web app_
        - ex. download < _send me free info_
    - __keep it short__
    - use natural, friendly language; __sound human, not a robot__
        - ex. email < _add your email here_

### Images and Imagery
- stock photos usually look like stock photos
- you can still accomplish a lot with __just type and screenshots__
- remember to pay attention to __file size__
- don't forget retina-quality images

### Design philosophy
__Good artists copy, Great artists steal__
- ex) starting design from scratch is like coding without stackoverflow

#### Use Inspiration
- look into other designs
    - [Dribble for inspiration](https://dribbble.com/)
- find what they have done well
- implement it in your designs

### Overview of design process
1. _-collect inspiration__ and __sketch ideas__:
    - pick out ideas from other designs
    - sketch out ideas of your own (scribble)
2. __mock-up__:
    - don't have to be pixel perfect
    - easier to move things and try
3. __build it__
4. __have someone use it__ (to see the user experience)

#### philosophy
- process: _crap, crap, crap, crap, crap, crap, crap, crap...maybe? yes!_
    - just because you're doing it like this, doesn't mean you're a bad designer, you're just a designer
- this is only the starting point!
- __the more practice, the better designer you will become__
- the __usability__ is more important than how it looks
    - rely on data (quantitative) than just aesthetics
