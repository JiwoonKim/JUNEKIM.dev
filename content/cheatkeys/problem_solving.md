### My Problem-solving Framework
1. __Understand__: be able to explain it in simple english/korean
2. __Plan__: write the plan of steps __in comments__
3. __Divide__:
    - break the problem into __sub-problems__
    - solve each problem one-by-one
    - connect the problems
    - if the problem seems to difficult, reduce it
4. Debug or Reassess:
    - __Debug__: go step by step through your solution trying to find where you went wrong
    - __Reassess__: take a step back and look at the problem from another perspective. Is there anything that can be abstracted to a more general approach?
