### Opening Keynote
Grace
- self awareness: limiting beliefs -> shape and color the decisions we make
- imposture syndrome: it's so normal to feel that. instead of just fearing they will find out you are a fraud, try to be brave and say __"someone made the mistake of hiring me, but I'M HERE and gonna do what I can do"__

### Bias Busting
- feeling included is important to help not hold back and affect your work ability
- stereotypical bias = taking a stereotype and generalizing it on a certain group
- train to intervene well to counter instances of bias
    - understand your bias towards inaction, timing
    "i don't want to work with [ ] group of people" = bias
    think of your unconscious,
    change your language, make bias conscious
- how to point it out: divert the conversation and revisit privately
    - don't just be the thought police, share why this matters to you, ask for another view

### I am Remarkable
men apply when they fill 60% of requirements
and say "hmm...i don't know this but I can sort of figure that out"
